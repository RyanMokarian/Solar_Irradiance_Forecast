	Description:
The goal of solar irradiance prediction is to help with the
electric grid management. This is a need that is increasingly important as solar
energy continue to expand. In this project, various deep learning
approaches (Convolutional Neural Network 2D and 3D, LSTM, GRU and Attention) compared
for the task of solar irradiance nowcasting at a speciÔ¨Åc location using
satellite imagery. The best RMSE by implicitly using the Clearsky model
to predict GHI was obtained. For details, refer to the uploaded Manuscript.

## How to Visualize Training with Tensorboard
Open an ssh session :
```
ssh -L 16006:127.0.0.1:6006 guest@helios3.calculquebec.ca
```
Run tensorboard : 
```
tensorboard --logdir=solar-irradiance/logs
```
Open the following url in your browser :
